# DJdj Development

### üéâ About us
Hi there! I'm [DJj123dj](https://github.com/DJj123dj), the founder of DJdj Development. I create most of the projects in this "fictional" company. üòâ I will try to explain the goal of DJdj Development in as much detail as possible!

### Our Focus
Our main focus is developing Discord bots. We create open and closed-source bots, npm packages and Discord related stuff! Outside Discord, we also create custom software for different purposes. Our goal is to create qualitative projects and to revolutionize the industry with new features!

### Experience
I (DJj123dj) have quite some experience with programming. I'm still a student in high school, but I love programming! I started when I was only 11 years old. My first language was Applescript! This was followed with Node.js and Discord bots. Trough the years I've continued to experiment with new languages and projects. By now I already know a lot of languages. Later I want to study Computer Science and make this hobby my job!

#### Popularity
Our most popular project (so far) is [Open Ticket](https://github.com/DJj123dj/open-ticket)! It's the most advanced open-source discord bot that currently exists! It contains a lot of cool features like transcripts, claiming, pinning, stats, blacklist, plugins and a lot of customisability!
